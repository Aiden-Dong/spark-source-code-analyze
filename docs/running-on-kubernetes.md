* This will become a table of contents (this text will be scraped).
{:toc}

Spark can run on clusters managed by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). This feature makes use of native
Kubernetes scheduler that has been added to Spark.

**The Kubernetes scheduler is currently experimental.
In future versions, there may be behavioral changes around configuration,
container images and entrypoints.**

# Prerequisites

* A runnable distribution of Spark 2.3 or above.
* A running Kubernetes cluster at version >= 1.6 with access configured to it using
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/).  If you do not already have a working Kubernetes cluster,
you may set up a test cluster on your local machine using
[minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/).
  * We recommend using the latest release of minikube with the DNS addon enabled.
  * Be aware that the default minikube configuration is not enough for running Spark applications.
  We recommend 3 CPUs and 4g of memory to be able to start a simple Spark application with a single
  executor.
* You must have appropriate permissions to list, create, edit and delete
[pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/) in your cluster. You can verify that you can list these resources
by running `kubectl auth can-i <list|create|edit|delete> pods`.
  * The service account credentials used by the driver pods must be allowed to create pods, services and configmaps.
* You must have [Kubernetes DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/) configured in your cluster.

# How it works

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="img/k8s-cluster-mode.png" title="Spark cluster components" alt="Spark cluster components" />
</p>

<code>spark-submit</code> can be directly used to submit a Spark application to a Kubernetes cluster.
The submission mechanism works as follows:

* Spark creates a Spark driver running within a [Kubernetes pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/).
* The driver creates executors which are also running within Kubernetes pods and connects to them, and executes application code.
* When the application completes, the executor pods terminate and are cleaned up, but the driver pod persists
logs and remains in "completed" state in the Kubernetes API until it's eventually garbage collected or manually cleaned up.

Note that in the completed state, the driver pod does *not* use any computational or memory resources.

The driver and executor pod scheduling is handled by Kubernetes. It is possible to schedule the
driver and executor pods on a subset of available nodes through a [node selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
using the configuration property for it. It will be possible to use more advanced
scheduling hints like [node/pod affinities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) in a future release.

# Submitting Applications to Kubernetes

## Docker Images

Kubernetes requires users to supply images that can be deployed into containers within pods. The images are built to
be run in a container runtime environment that Kubernetes supports. Docker is a container runtime environment that is
frequently used with Kubernetes. Spark (starting with version 2.3) ships with a Dockerfile that can be used for this
purpose, or customized to match an individual application's needs. It can be found in the `kubernetes/dockerfiles/`
directory.

Spark also ships with a `bin/docker-image-tool.sh` script that can be used to build and publish the Docker images to
use with the Kubernetes backend.

Example usage is:

```bash
$ ./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r <repo> -t my-tag build
$ ./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r <repo> -t my-tag push
```

## Cluster Mode

To launch Spark Pi in cluster mode,

```bash
$ bin/spark-submit \
    --master k8s://https://<k8s-apiserver-host>:<k8s-apiserver-port> \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --name spark-pi \
    --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=5 \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<spark-image> \
    local:///path/to/examples.jar
```

The Spark master, specified either via passing the `--master` command line argument to `spark-submit` or by setting
`spark.master` in the application's configuration, must be a URL with the format `k8s://<api_server_url>`. Prefixing the
master string with `k8s://` will cause the Spark application to launch on the Kubernetes cluster, with the API server
being contacted at `api_server_url`. If no HTTP protocol is specified in the URL, it defaults to `https`. For example,
setting the master to `k8s://example.com:443` is equivalent to setting it to `k8s://https://example.com:443`, but to
connect without TLS on a different port, the master would be set to `k8s://http://example.com:8080`.

In Kubernetes mode, the Spark application name that is specified by `spark.app.name` or the `--name` argument to
`spark-submit` is used by default to name the Kubernetes resources created like drivers and executors. So, application names
must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `.`  and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

If you have a Kubernetes cluster setup, one way to discover the apiserver URL is by executing `kubectl cluster-info`.

```bash
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at http://127.0.0.1:6443
```

In the above example, the specific Kubernetes cluster can be used with <code>spark-submit</code> by specifying
`--master k8s://http://127.0.0.1:6443` as an argument to spark-submit. Additionally, it is also possible to use the
authenticating proxy, `kubectl proxy` to communicate to the Kubernetes API.

The local proxy can be started by:

```bash
$ kubectl proxy
```

If the local proxy is running at localhost:8001, `--master k8s://http://127.0.0.1:8001` can be used as the argument to
spark-submit. Finally, notice that in the above example we specify a jar with a specific URI with a scheme of `local://`.
This URI is the location of the example jar that is already in the Docker image.

## Client Mode

Starting with Spark 2.4.0, it is possible to run Spark applications on Kubernetes in client mode. When your application
runs in client mode, the driver can run inside a pod or on a physical host. When running an application in client mode,
it is recommended to account for the following factors:

### Client Mode Networking

Spark executors must be able to connect to the Spark driver over a hostname and a port that is routable from the Spark
executors. The specific network configuration that will be required for Spark to work in client mode will vary per
setup. If you run your driver inside a Kubernetes pod, you can use a
[headless service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) to allow your
driver pod to be routable from the executors by a stable hostname. When deploying your headless service, ensure that
the service's label selector will only match the driver pod and no other pods; it is recommended to assign your driver
pod a sufficiently unique label and to use that label in the label selector of the headless service. Specify the driver's
hostname via `spark.driver.host` and your spark driver's port to `spark.driver.port`.

### Client Mode Executor Pod Garbage Collection

If you run your Spark driver in a pod, it is highly recommended to set `spark.driver.pod.name` to the name of that pod.
When this property is set, the Spark scheduler will deploy the executor pods with an
[OwnerReference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/), which in turn will
ensure that once the driver pod is deleted from the cluster, all of the application's executor pods will also be deleted.
The driver will look for a pod with the given name in the namespace specified by `spark.kubernetes.namespace`, and
an OwnerReference pointing to that pod will be added to each executor pod's OwnerReferences list. Be careful to avoid
setting the OwnerReference to a pod that is not actually that driver pod, or else the executors may be terminated
prematurely when the wrong pod is deleted.

If your application is not running inside a pod, or if `spark.driver.pod.name` is not set when your application is
actually running in a pod, keep in mind that the executor pods may not be properly deleted from the cluster when the
application exits. The Spark scheduler attempts to delete these pods, but if the network request to the API server fails
for any reason, these pods will remain in the cluster. The executor processes should exit when they cannot reach the
driver, so the executor pods should not consume compute resources (cpu and memory) in the cluster after your application
exits.

### Authentication Parameters

Use the exact prefix `spark.kubernetes.authenticate` for Kubernetes authentication parameters in client mode.

## Dependency Management

If your application's dependencies are all hosted in remote locations like HDFS or HTTP servers, they may be referred to
by their appropriate remote URIs. Also, application dependencies can be pre-mounted into custom-built Docker images.
Those dependencies can be added to the classpath by referencing them with `local://` URIs and/or setting the
`SPARK_EXTRA_CLASSPATH` environment variable in your Dockerfiles. The `local://` scheme is also required when referring to
dependencies in custom-built Docker images in `spark-submit`. Note that using application dependencies from the submission
client's local file system is currently not yet supported.

## Secret Management
Kubernetes [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) can be used to provide credentials for a
Spark application to access secured services. To mount a user-specified secret into the driver container, users can use
the configuration property of the form `spark.kubernetes.driver.secrets.[SecretName]=<mount path>`. Similarly, the
configuration property of the form `spark.kubernetes.executor.secrets.[SecretName]=<mount path>` can be used to mount a
user-specified secret into the executor containers. Note that it is assumed that the secret to be mounted is in the same
namespace as that of the driver and executor pods. For example, to mount a secret named `spark-secret` onto the path
`/etc/secrets` in both the driver and executor containers, add the following options to the `spark-submit` command:

```
--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.secrets.spark-secret=/etc/secrets
--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.secrets.spark-secret=/etc/secrets
```

To use a secret through an environment variable use the following options to the `spark-submit` command:
```
--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.secretKeyRef.ENV_NAME=name:key
--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.secretKeyRef.ENV_NAME=name:key
```

## Using Kubernetes Volumes

Starting with Spark 2.4.0, users can mount the following types of Kubernetes [volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) into the driver and executor pods:
* [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath): mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into a pod.
* [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir): an initially empty volume created when a pod is assigned to a node.
* [persistentVolumeClaim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#persistentvolumeclaim): used to mount a `PersistentVolume` into a pod.

To mount a volume of any of the types above into the driver pod, use the following configuration property:

```
--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.[VolumeType].[VolumeName].mount.path=<mount path>
--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.[VolumeType].[VolumeName].mount.readOnly=<true|false>
``` 

Specifically, `VolumeType` can be one of the following values: `hostPath`, `emptyDir`, and `persistentVolumeClaim`. `VolumeName` is the name you want to use for the volume under the `volumes` field in the pod specification.

Each supported type of volumes may have some specific configuration options, which can be specified using configuration properties of the following form:

```
spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.[VolumeType].[VolumeName].options.[OptionName]=<value>
``` 

For example, the claim name of a `persistentVolumeClaim` with volume name `checkpointpvc` can be specified using the following property:

```
spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.checkpointpvc.options.claimName=check-point-pvc-claim
```

The configuration properties for mounting volumes into the executor pods use prefix `spark.kubernetes.executor.` instead of `spark.kubernetes.driver.`. For a complete list of available options for each supported type of volumes, please refer to the [Spark Properties](#spark-properties) section below. 

## Introspection and Debugging

These are the different ways in which you can investigate a running/completed Spark application, monitor progress, and
take actions.

### Accessing Logs

Logs can be accessed using the Kubernetes API and the `kubectl` CLI. When a Spark application is running, it's possible
to stream logs from the application using:

```bash
$ kubectl -n=<namespace> logs -f <driver-pod-name>
```

The same logs can also be accessed through the
[Kubernetes dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) if installed on
the cluster.

### Accessing Driver UI

The UI associated with any application can be accessed locally using
[`kubectl port-forward`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/#forward-a-local-port-to-a-port-on-the-pod).

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward <driver-pod-name> 4040:4040
```

Then, the Spark driver UI can be accessed on `http://localhost:4040`.

### Debugging

There may be several kinds of failures. If the Kubernetes API server rejects the request made from spark-submit, or the
connection is refused for a different reason, the submission logic should indicate the error encountered. However, if there
are errors during the running of the application, often, the best way to investigate may be through the Kubernetes CLI.

To get some basic information about the scheduling decisions made around the driver pod, you can run:

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod <spark-driver-pod>
```

If the pod has encountered a runtime error, the status can be probed further using:

```bash
$ kubectl logs <spark-driver-pod>
```

Status and logs of failed executor pods can be checked in similar ways. Finally, deleting the driver pod will clean up the entire spark
application, including all executors, associated service, etc. The driver pod can be thought of as the Kubernetes representation of
the Spark application.

## Kubernetes Features

### Namespaces

Kubernetes has the concept of [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).
Namespaces are ways to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota). Spark on Kubernetes can
use namespaces to launch Spark applications. This can be made use of through the `spark.kubernetes.namespace` configuration.

Kubernetes allows using [ResourceQuota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) to set limits on
resources, number of objects, etc on individual namespaces. Namespaces and ResourceQuota can be used in combination by
administrator to control sharing and resource allocation in a Kubernetes cluster running Spark applications.

### RBAC

In Kubernetes clusters with [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) enabled, users can configure
Kubernetes RBAC roles and service accounts used by the various Spark on Kubernetes components to access the Kubernetes
API server.

The Spark driver pod uses a Kubernetes service account to access the Kubernetes API server to create and watch executor
pods. The service account used by the driver pod must have the appropriate permission for the driver to be able to do
its work. Specifically, at minimum, the service account must be granted a
[`Role` or `ClusterRole`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole) that allows driver
pods to create pods and services. By default, the driver pod is automatically assigned the `default` service account in
the namespace specified by `spark.kubernetes.namespace`, if no service account is specified when the pod gets created.

Depending on the version and setup of Kubernetes deployed, this `default` service account may or may not have the role
that allows driver pods to create pods and services under the default Kubernetes
[RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) policies. Sometimes users may need to specify a custom
service account that has the right role granted. Spark on Kubernetes supports specifying a custom service account to
be used by the driver pod through the configuration property
`spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=<service account name>`. For example, to make the driver pod
use the `spark` service account, a user simply adds the following option to the `spark-submit` command:

```
--conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=spark
```

To create a custom service account, a user can use the `kubectl create serviceaccount` command. For example, the
following command creates a service account named `spark`:

```bash
$ kubectl create serviceaccount spark
```

To grant a service account a `Role` or `ClusterRole`, a `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` is needed. To create
a `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding`, a user can use the `kubectl create rolebinding` (or `clusterrolebinding`
for `ClusterRoleBinding`) command. For example, the following command creates an `edit` `ClusterRole` in the `default`
namespace and grants it to the `spark` service account created above:

```bash
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding spark-role --clusterrole=edit --serviceaccount=default:spark --namespace=default
```

Note that a `Role` can only be used to grant access to resources (like pods) within a single namespace, whereas a
`ClusterRole` can be used to grant access to cluster-scoped resources (like nodes) as well as namespaced resources
(like pods) across all namespaces. For Spark on Kubernetes, since the driver always creates executor pods in the
same namespace, a `Role` is sufficient, although users may use a `ClusterRole` instead. For more information on
RBAC authorization and how to configure Kubernetes service accounts for pods, please refer to
[Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) and
[Configure Service Accounts for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).

## Future Work

There are several Spark on Kubernetes features that are currently being worked on or planned to be worked on. Those features are expected to eventually make it into future versions of the spark-kubernetes integration.

Some of these include:

* Dynamic Resource Allocation and External Shuffle Service
* Local File Dependency Management
* Spark Application Management
* Job Queues and Resource Management

    Name of the driver pod. In cluster mode, if this is not set, the driver pod name is set to "spark.app.name"
    suffixed by the current timestamp to avoid name conflicts. In client mode, if your application is running
    inside a pod, it is highly recommended to set this to the name of the pod your driver is running in. Setting this
    value in client mode allows the driver to become the owner of its executor pods, which in turn allows the executor
    pods to be garbage collected by the cluster.
