Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R,
and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including [Spark SQL](sql-programming-guide.html) for SQL and structured data processing, [MLlib](ml-guide.html) for machine learning, [GraphX](graphx-programming-guide.html) for graph processing, and [Spark Streaming](streaming-programming-guide.html).

# Downloading

Get Spark from the [downloads page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) of the project website. This documentation is for Spark version {{site.SPARK_VERSION}}. Spark uses Hadoop's client libraries for HDFS and YARN. Downloads are pre-packaged for a handful of popular Hadoop versions.
Users can also download a "Hadoop free" binary and run Spark with any Hadoop version
[by augmenting Spark's classpath](hadoop-provided.html).
Scala and Java users can include Spark in their projects using its Maven coordinates and in the future Python users can also install Spark from PyPI.


If you'd like to build Spark from 
source, visit [Building Spark](building-spark.html).


Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS). It's easy to run
locally on one machine --- all you need is to have `java` installed on your system `PATH`,
or the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 8+, Python 2.7+/3.4+ and R 3.1+. For the Scala API, Spark {{site.SPARK_VERSION}}
uses Scala {{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}. You will need to use a compatible Scala version
({{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}.x).

Note that support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and old Hadoop versions before 2.6.5 were removed as of Spark 2.2.0.
Support for Scala 2.10 was removed as of 2.3.0.

# Running the Examples and Shell

Spark comes with several sample programs.  Scala, Java, Python and R examples are in the
`examples/src/main` directory. To run one of the Java or Scala sample programs, use
`bin/run-example <class> [params]` in the top-level Spark directory. (Behind the scenes, this
invokes the more general
[`spark-submit` script](submitting-applications.html) for
launching applications). For example,

    ./bin/run-example SparkPi 10

You can also run Spark interactively through a modified version of the Scala shell. This is a
great way to learn the framework.

    ./bin/spark-shell --master local[2]

The `--master` option specifies the
[master URL for a distributed cluster](submitting-applications.html#master-urls), or `local` to run
locally with one thread, or `local[N]` to run locally with N threads. You should start by using
`local` for testing. For a full list of options, run Spark shell with the `--help` option.

Spark also provides a Python API. To run Spark interactively in a Python interpreter, use
`bin/pyspark`:

    ./bin/pyspark --master local[2]

Example applications are also provided in Python. For example,

    ./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/pi.py 10

Spark also provides an experimental [R API](sparkr.html) since 1.4 (only DataFrames APIs included).
To run Spark interactively in a R interpreter, use `bin/sparkR`:

    ./bin/sparkR --master local[2]

Example applications are also provided in R. For example,

    ./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/r/dataframe.R

# Launching on a Cluster

The Spark [cluster mode overview](cluster-overview.html) explains the key concepts in running on a cluster.
Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several
options for deployment:

* [Standalone Deploy Mode](spark-standalone.html): simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
* [Apache Mesos](running-on-mesos.html)
* [Hadoop YARN](running-on-yarn.html)
* [Kubernetes](running-on-kubernetes.html)
