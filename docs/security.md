# Spark RPC

## Authentication

Spark currently supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret. Authentication can
be turned on by setting the `spark.authenticate` configuration parameter.

The exact mechanism used to generate and distribute the shared secret is deployment-specific.

For Spark on [YARN](running-on-yarn.html) and local deployments, Spark will automatically handle
generating and distributing the shared secret. Each application will use a unique shared secret. In
the case of YARN, this feature relies on YARN RPC encryption being enabled for the distribution of
secrets to be secure.

For other resource managers, `spark.authenticate.secret` must be configured on each of the nodes.
This secret will be shared by all the daemons and applications, so this deployment configuration is
not as secure as the above, especially when considering multi-tenant clusters.  In this
configuration, a user with the secret can effectively impersonate any other user.

The Rest Submission Server and the MesosClusterDispatcher do not support authentication.  You should
ensure that all network access to the REST API & MesosClusterDispatcher (port 6066 and 7077
respectively by default) are restricted to hosts that are trusted to submit jobs.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.authenticate</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>Whether Spark authenticates its internal connections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.authenticate.secret</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    The secret key used authentication. See above for when this configuration should be set.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Encryption

Spark supports AES-based encryption for RPC connections. For encryption to be enabled, RPC
authentication must also be enabled and properly configured. AES encryption uses the
[Apache Commons Crypto](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-crypto/) library, and Spark's
configuration system allows access to that library's configuration for advanced users.

There is also support for SASL-based encryption, although it should be considered deprecated. It
is still required when talking to shuffle services from Spark versions older than 2.2.0.

The following table describes the different options available for configuring this feature.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.crypto.enabled</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Enable AES-based RPC encryption, including the new authentication protocol added in 2.2.0.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.crypto.keyLength</code></td>
  <td>128</td>
  <td>
    The length in bits of the encryption key to generate. Valid values are 128, 192 and 256.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.crypto.keyFactoryAlgorithm</code></td>
  <td>PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1</td>
  <td>
    The key factory algorithm to use when generating encryption keys. Should be one of the
    algorithms supported by the javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory class in the JRE being used.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.crypto.config.*</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Configuration values for the commons-crypto library, such as which cipher implementations to

</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.crypto.saslFallback</code></td>
  <td>true</td>
  <td>
    Whether to fall back to SASL authentication if authentication fails using Spark's internal
    mechanism. This is useful when the application is connecting to old shuffle services that
    do not support the internal Spark authentication protocol. On the shuffle service side,
    disabling this feature will block older clients from authenticating.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Enable SASL-based encrypted communication.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.network.sasl.serverAlwaysEncrypt</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Disable unencrypted connections for ports using SASL authentication. This will deny connections
    from clients that have authentication enabled, but do not request SASL-based encryption.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>


# Local Storage Encryption

Spark supports encrypting temporary data written to local disks. This covers shuffle files, shuffle
spills and data blocks stored on disk (for both caching and broadcast variables). It does not cover
encrypting output data generated by applications with APIs such as `saveAsHadoopFile` or
`saveAsTable`.

The following settings cover enabling encryption for data written to disk:

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.io.encryption.enabled</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Enable local disk I/O encryption. Currently supported by all modes except Mesos. It's strongly
    recommended that RPC encryption be enabled when using this feature.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.io.encryption.keySizeBits</code></td>
  <td>128</td>
  <td>
    IO encryption key size in bits. Supported values are 128, 192 and 256.

  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Configuration values for the commons-crypto library, such as which cipher implementations to
    use. The config name should be the name of commons-crypto configuration without the
    <code>commons.crypto</code> prefix.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>


# Web UI

## Authentication and Authorization

Enabling authentication for the Web UIs is done using [javax servlet filters](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html).
You will need a filter that implements the authentication method you want to deploy. Spark does not
provide any built-in authentication filters.

Spark also supports access control to the UI when an authentication filter is present. Each
application can be configured with its own separate access control lists (ACLs). Spark
differentiates between "view" permissions (who is allowed to see the application's UI), and "modify"
permissions (who can do things like kill jobs in a running application).

ACLs can be configured for either users or groups. Configuration entries accept comma-separated
lists as input, meaning multiple users or groups can be given the desired privileges. This can be
used if you run on a shared cluster and have a set of administrators or developers who need to
monitor applications they may not have started themselves. A wildcard (`*`) added to specific ACL
means that all users will have the respective privilege. By default, only the user submitting the
application is added to the ACLs.

Group membership is established by using a configurable group mapping provider. The mapper is
configured using the <code>spark.user.groups.mapping</code> config option, described in the table
below.

The following options control the authentication of Web UIs:

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.filters</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    See the <a href="configuration.html#spark-ui">Spark UI</a> configuration for how to configure
    filters.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.acls.enable</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Whether UI ACLs should be enabled. If enabled, this checks to see if the user has access
    permissions to view or modify the application. Note this requires the user to be authenticated,
    so if no authentication filter is installed, this option does not do anything.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.admin.acls</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of users that have view and modify access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.admin.acls.groups</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of groups that have view and modify access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.modify.acls</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of users that have modify access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.modify.acls.groups</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of groups that have modify access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.view.acls</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of users that have view access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.view.acls.groups</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma-separated list of groups that have view access to the Spark application.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.user.groups.mapping</code></td>
  <td><code>org.apache.spark.security.ShellBasedGroupsMappingProvider</code></td>
  <td>
    The list of groups for a user is determined by a group mapping service defined by the trait
    <code>org.apache.spark.security.GroupMappingServiceProvider</code>, which can be configured by
    this property.

    <br />By default, a Unix shell-based implementation is used, which collects this information
    from the host OS.

    <br /><em>Note:</em> This implementation supports only Unix/Linux-based environments.
    Windows environment is currently <b>not</b> supported. However, a new platform/protocol can
    be supported by implementing the trait mentioned above.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

On YARN, the view and modify ACLs are provided to the YARN service when submitting applications, and
control who has the respective privileges via YARN interfaces.

## Spark History Server ACLs

Authentication for the SHS Web UI is enabled the same way as for regular applications, using
servlet filters.

To enable authorization in the SHS, a few extra options are used:

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.history.ui.acls.enable</code></td>
  <td>false</td>
  <td>
    Specifies whether ACLs should be checked to authorize users viewing the applications in
    the history server. If enabled, access control checks are performed regardless of what the
    individual applications had set for <code>spark.ui.acls.enable</code>. The application owner
    will always have authorization to view their own application and any users specified via
    <code>spark.ui.view.acls</code> and groups specified via <code>spark.ui.view.acls.groups</code>
    when the application was run will also have authorization to view that application.
    If disabled, no access control checks are made for any application UIs available through
    the history server.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.history.ui.admin.acls</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma separated list of users that have view access to all the Spark applications in history
    server.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.history.ui.admin.acls.groups</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Comma separated list of groups that have view access to all the Spark applications in history
    server.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

The SHS uses the same options to configure the group mapping provider as regular applications.
In this case, the group mapping provider will apply to all UIs server by the SHS, and individual
application configurations will be ignored.

## SSL Configuration

Configuration for SSL is organized hierarchically. The user can configure the default SSL settings
which will be used for all the supported communication protocols unless they are overwritten by
protocol-specific settings. This way the user can easily provide the common settings for all the
protocols without disabling the ability to configure each one individually. The following table
describes the the SSL configuration namespaces:

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Config Namespace</th>
    <th>Component</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>spark.ssl</code></td>
    <td>
      The default SSL configuration. These values will apply to all namespaces below, unless
      explicitly overridden at the namespace level.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>spark.ssl.ui</code></td>
    <td>Spark application Web UI</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>spark.ssl.standalone</code></td>
    <td>Standalone Master / Worker Web UI</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>spark.ssl.historyServer</code></td>
    <td>History Server Web UI</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The full breakdown of available SSL options can be found below. The `${ns}` placeholder should be
replaced with one of the above namespaces.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>${ns}.enabled</code></td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>Enables SSL. When enabled, <code>${ns}.ssl.protocol</code> is required.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>${ns}.port</code></td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>
      The port where the SSL service will listen on.

      <br />The port must be defined within a specific namespace configuration. The default
      namespace is ignored when reading this configuration.

      <br />When not set, the SSL port will be derived from the non-SSL port for the
      same service. A value of "0" will make the service bind to an ephemeral port.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>${ns}.enabledAlgorithms</code></td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>
      A comma-separated list of ciphers. The specified ciphers must be supported by JVM.

      <br />The reference list of protocols can be found in the "JSSE Cipher Suite Names" section

      page.

      <br />Note: If not set, the default cipher suite for the JRE will be used.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>${ns}.keyPassword</code></td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>
      Path to the key store file. The path can be absolute or relative to the directory in which the
      process is started.

    <td>Password for the trust store.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>${ns}.trustStoreType</code></td>
    <td>JKS</td>
    <td>The type of the trust store.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Spark also supports retrieving `${ns}.keyPassword`, `${ns}.keyStorePassword` and `${ns}.trustStorePassword` from
[Hadoop Credential Providers](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CredentialProviderAPI.html).
User could store password into credential file and make it accessible by different components, like:

```
hadoop credential create spark.ssl.keyPassword -value password \
    -provider jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/ssl.jceks
```

To configure the location of the credential provider, set the `hadoop.security.credential.provider.path`
config option in the Hadoop configuration used by Spark, like:

```
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
    <value>jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/ssl.jceks</value>
  </property>
```

Or via SparkConf "spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/ssl.jceks".

## Preparing the key stores

Key stores can be generated by `keytool` program. The reference documentation for this tool for
Java 8 is [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html).
The most basic steps to configure the key stores and the trust store for a Spark Standalone
deployment mode is as follows:

* Generate a key pair for each node
* Export the public key of the key pair to a file on each node
* Import all exported public keys into a single trust store
* Distribute the trust store to the cluster nodes

### YARN mode

To provide a local trust store or key store file to drivers running in cluster mode, they can be
distributed with the application using the `--files` command line argument (or the equivalent
`spark.files` configuration). The files will be placed on the driver's working directory, so the TLS
configuration should just reference the file name with no absolute path.

Distributing local key stores this way may require the files to be staged in HDFS (or other similar
distributed file system used by the cluster), so it's recommended that the underlying file system be
configured with security in mind (e.g. by enabling authentication and wire encryption).

### Standalone mode

The user needs to provide key stores and configuration options for master and workers. They have to
be set by attaching appropriate Java system properties in `SPARK_MASTER_OPTS` and in
`SPARK_WORKER_OPTS` environment variables, or just in `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`.

The user may allow the executors to use the SSL settings inherited from the worker process. That
can be accomplished by setting `spark.ssl.useNodeLocalConf` to `true`. In that case, the settings
provided by the user on the client side are not used.

### Mesos mode

Mesos 1.3.0 and newer supports `Secrets` primitives as both file-based and environment based
secrets. Spark allows the specification of file-based and environment variable based secrets with
`spark.mesos.driver.secret.filenames` and `spark.mesos.driver.secret.envkeys`, respectively.

Depending on the secret store backend secrets can be passed by reference or by value with the
`spark.mesos.driver.secret.names` and `spark.mesos.driver.secret.values` configuration properties,
respectively.

Reference type secrets are served by the secret store and referred to by name, for example
`/mysecret`. Value type secrets are passed on the command line and translated into their
appropriate files or environment variables.

## HTTP Security Headers

Apache Spark can be configured to include HTTP headers to aid in preventing Cross Site Scripting
(XSS), Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS), MIME-Sniffing, and also to enforce HTTP Strict Transport
Security.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.xXssProtection</code></td>
  <td><code>1; mode=block</code></td>
  <td>
    Value for HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header. You can choose appropriate value
    from below:
    <ul>
      <li><code>0</code> (Disables XSS filtering)</li>
      <li><code>1</code> (Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected,
        the browser will sanitize the page.)</li>
      <li><code>1; mode=block</code> (Enables XSS filtering. The browser will prevent rendering
        of the page if an attack is detected.)</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.xContentTypeOptions.enabled</code></td>
  <td><code>true</code></td>
  <td>
    When enabled, X-Content-Type-Options HTTP response header will be set to "nosniff".
  </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.ui.strictTransportSecurity</code></td>
  <td>None</td>
  <td>
    Value for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Response Header. You can choose appropriate
    value from below and set <code>expire-time</code> accordingly. This option is only used when
    SSL/TLS is enabled.
    <ul>
      <li><code>max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;</code></li>
      <li><code>max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;; includeSubDomains</code></li>
      <li><code>max-age=&lt;expire-time&gt;; preload</code></li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>

# Configuring Ports for Network Security

Generally speaking, a Spark cluster and its services are not deployed on the public internet.
They are generally private services, and should only be accessible within the network of the
organization that deploys Spark. Access to the hosts and ports used by Spark services should
be limited to origin hosts that need to access the services.

Below are the primary ports that Spark uses for its communication and how to
configure those ports.

## Standalone mode only

# Kerberos

Spark supports submitting applications in environments that use Kerberos for authentication.
In most cases, Spark relies on the credentials of the current logged in user when authenticating
to Kerberos-aware services. Such credentials can be obtained by logging in to the configured KDC
with tools like `kinit`.

When talking to Hadoop-based services, Spark needs to obtain delegation tokens so that non-local
processes can authenticate. Spark ships with support for HDFS and other Hadoop file systems, Hive
and HBase.

When using a Hadoop filesystem (such HDFS or WebHDFS), Spark will acquire the relevant tokens
for the service hosting the user's home directory.

An HBase token will be obtained if HBase is in the application's classpath, and the HBase
configuration has Kerberos authentication turned (`hbase.security.authentication=kerberos`).

Similarly, a Hive token will be obtained if Hive is in the classpath, and the configuration includes
URIs for remote metastore services (`hive.metastore.uris` is not empty).

Delegation token support is currently only supported in YARN and Mesos modes. Consult the
deployment-specific page for more information.

The following options provides finer-grained control for this feature:

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.security.credentials.${service}.enabled</code></td>
  <td><code>true</code></td>
  <td>
  Controls whether to obtain credentials for services when security is enabled.
  By default, credentials for all supported services are retrieved when those services are
  configured, but it's possible to disable that behavior if it somehow conflicts with the
  application being run.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Long-Running Applications

Long-running applications may run into issues if their run time exceeds the maximum delegation
token lifetime configured in services it needs to access.

Spark supports automatically creating new tokens for these applications when running in YARN mode.
Kerberos credentials need to be provided to the Spark application via the `spark-submit` command,
using the `--principal` and `--keytab` parameters.

The provided keytab will be copied over to the machine running the Application Master via the Hadoop
Distributed Cache. For this reason, it's strongly recommended that both YARN and HDFS be secured
with encryption, at least.

The Kerberos login will be periodically renewed using the provided credentials, and new delegation
tokens for supported will be created.


# Event Logging

If your applications are using event logging, the directory where the event logs go
(`spark.eventLog.dir`) should be manually created with proper permissions. To secure the log files,
the directory permissions should be set to `drwxrwxrwxt`. The owner and group of the directory
should correspond to the super user who is running the Spark History Server.

This will allow all users to write to the directory but will prevent unprivileged users from
reading, removing or renaming a file unless they own it. The event log files will be created by
Spark with permissions such that only the user and group have read and write access.
