/**
 * A KVStore wrapper that allows tracking the number of elements of specific types, and triggering
 * actions once they reach a threshold. This allows writers, for example, to control how much data
 * is stored by potentially deleting old data as new data is added.
 *
 * This store is used when populating data either from a live UI or an event log. On top of firing
 * triggers when elements reach a certain threshold, it provides two extra bits of functionality:
 *
 * - a generic worker thread that can be used to run expensive tasks asynchronously; the tasks can
 *   be configured to run on the calling thread when more determinism is desired (e.g. unit tests).
 * - a generic flush mechanism so that listeners can be notified about when they should flush
 *   internal state to the store (e.g. after the SHS finishes parsing an event log).
 *
 * The configured triggers are run on a separate thread by default; they can be forced to run on
 * the calling thread by setting the `ASYNC_TRACKING_ENABLED` configuration to `false`.
