/**
 * :: Experimental ::
 * A base class for user-defined aggregations, which can be used in `Dataset` operations to take
 * all of the elements of a group and reduce them to a single value.
 *
 * For example, the following aggregator extracts an `int` from a specific class and adds them up:
 * {{{
 *   case class Data(i: Int)
 *
 *   val customSummer =  new Aggregator[Data, Int, Int] {
 *     def zero: Int = 0
 *     def reduce(b: Int, a: Data): Int = b + a.i
 *     def merge(b1: Int, b2: Int): Int = b1 + b2
 *     def finish(r: Int): Int = r
 *   }.toColumn()
 *
 *   val ds: Dataset[Data] = ...
 *   val aggregated = ds.select(customSummer)
 * }}}
 *
 * Based loosely on Aggregator from Algebird: https://github.com/twitter/algebird
 *
 * @tparam IN The input type for the aggregation.
 * @tparam BUF The type of the intermediate value of the reduction.
 * @tparam OUT The type of the final output result.
 * @since 1.6.0
