/**
 * [[AnalysisHelper]] defines some infrastructure for the query analyzer. In particular, in query
 * analysis we don't want to repeatedly re-analyze sub-plans that have previously been analyzed.
 *
 * This trait defines a flag `analyzed` that can be set to true once analysis is done on the tree.
 * This also provides a set of resolve methods that do not recurse down to sub-plans that have the
 * analyzed flag set to true.
 *
 * The analyzer rules should use the various resolve methods, in lieu of the various transform
 * methods defined in [[TreeNode]] and [[QueryPlan]].
 *
 * To prevent accidental use of the transform methods, this trait also overrides the transform
 * methods to throw exceptions in test mode, if they are used in the analyzer.
