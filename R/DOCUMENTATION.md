# SparkR Documentation

SparkR documentation is generated by using in-source comments and annotated by using
[`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html). After making changes to the documentation and generating man pages,
you can run the following from an R console in the SparkR home directory
```R
library(devtools)
devtools::document(pkg="./pkg", roclets=c("rd"))
```
You can verify if your changes are good by running

    R CMD check pkg/
