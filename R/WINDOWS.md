## Building SparkR on Windows

To build SparkR on Windows, the following steps are required

1. Install R (>= 3.1) and [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Make sure to
include Rtools and R in `PATH`.

2. Install
[JDK8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and set
`JAVA_HOME` in the system environment variables.

3. Download and install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html). Also include the `bin`
directory in Maven in `PATH`.

4. Set `MAVEN_OPTS` as described in [Building Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html).

5. Open a command shell (`cmd`) in the Spark directory and build Spark with [Maven](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#buildmvn) and include the `-Psparkr` profile to build the R package. For example to use the default Hadoop versions you can run

    ```bash
    mvn.cmd -DskipTests -Psparkr package
    ```

    `.\build\mvn` is a shell script so `mvn.cmd` should be used directly on Windows.

##  Unit tests

To run the SparkR unit tests on Windows, the following steps are required â€”assuming you are in the Spark root directory and do not have Apache Hadoop installed already:

1. Create a folder to download Hadoop related files for Windows. For example, `cd ..` and `mkdir hadoop`.

2. Download the relevant Hadoop bin package from [steveloughran/winutils](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils). While these are not official ASF artifacts, they are built from the ASF release git hashes by a Hadoop PMC member on a dedicated Windows VM. For further reading, consult [Windows Problems on the Hadoop wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/WindowsProblems).

3. Install the files into `hadoop\bin`; make sure that `winutils.exe` and `hadoop.dll` are present.

4. Set the environment variable `HADOOP_HOME` to the full path to the newly created `hadoop` directory.

5. Run unit tests for SparkR by running the command below. You need to install the needed packages following the instructions under [Running R Tests](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#running-r-tests) first:

    ```
    .\bin\spark-submit2.cmd --conf spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS="file:///" R\pkg\tests\run-all.R
    ```
